Track your vegan impact by adding people that have gone or are going vegan,
vegetarian, plant-based, etc, because of your activism! Add custom labels and
colors to organize your tree. If you invite and attach other accounts to your
tree by username, youâ€™ll be able to see their live tree (and stats) get added to
your own!

## Setup

See the [Vegan Hacktivists documentation](https://github.com/veganhacktivists/documentation).
